# Introduction to Algorithms

- Binary Search needs sorted data to work
- Binary Search is O(log n) while Linear Search is O(n)
- Logarithms are the flip of exponentials
- Binary Search basically split the data in a half every time it makes a guess
- O(n) is linear time and O(log n) is logarithmic time
- Big O establishes a worst-case run time
- Algorithm speed isnt measured in second, but in growth of the number of operations.
- Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big O notation

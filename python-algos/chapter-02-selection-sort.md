# Selection sort

- Memory in computers is basically a big drawer
- when we need space for something we ask the computer for memory and the computer give us the  address of a slot in memory
- An Address in memory looks like this: FE0FFEEB
- With linked list each items stores the address of the next item in the list
- A bunch of random memory addresses are linked together
- Adding an item to a linked list is more easy: you stick it anywhere in memory and store the address with the previous item
- Linked lists are so much better at INSERTS
- Linked lists have the problem that if you want a X number you have to go one by one until you get to that item.
- With arrays, you know the address for every item. It becomes simpler to read.
- Arrays have O(1) Reading, O(n) Insertion and O(n) Deletion.
- Linked list have O(n) Insertion, O(1) Insertion and O(1) Deletion.
- Theres two different types of acces: RANDOM ACCES and SEQUENTIAL ACCESS.
- SEQUENTIAL access means reading the elements one by one
- Linked List only can do sequential access
- RANDOM acces means you can jump directly to the X element.

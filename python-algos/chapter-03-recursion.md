# Recursion

- Theres no performance benefit to using recursion; in fact, loops are sometimes better for performance.
- Every recursion function has two parts: the base case, and the recursive case.
- The base case is when the function doesnt call itself again. The recursive case is when the function calls itself.
- When you call a function from another function, the calling function is paused in a partially completed state.
- Recursion is when a function call itself
- A stack has two operations: push and pop.
- All function calls go onto the call stack.
